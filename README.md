# 💬 Advice Generator App

I built this small project using **React** as part of the [Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).  
It’s an app that shows random advice using the **Advice Slip API**, and each time you click the dice button, a new advice appears 💡

---

##  What I did
- Used `fetch()` to get random advice from the API.
- Displayed advice ID and text dynamically.
- Designed the layout using pure CSS.
- Added hover effects and responsive design.
- Used the **Manrope** font from Google Fonts.

## Tools & Tech
- React.js  
- CSS3  
- Advice Slip API  
- Google Fonts
